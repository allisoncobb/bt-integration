						What is Buildertrend integration?
					</h2>
						<p>
							Buildertrend integration comes in 3 options: contact form, login box and reviews. On your Getting Started Guide you selected the login box. Code has been prepared specifcally for your company.
						</p>
						<hr>
					<h2>
						What did I receive?
					</h2>
						<p>
							In your email, you will  nd your HTML code for the login box, which looks like this:<br />
							<img src="assets/loginbox-code-1.png" class="screenshot-code">
						</p>
						<hr>
					<h2>
						Where do I put this code?
					</h2>
						<p>
							You can place this code directly in the body of your website where you would like it to go. You can place it wherever works best for your company - create a new page just for the login box, or place it on an existing page (such as the bottom of your home page).
						</p>
						<hr>
					<h2>
						How do I put the code on my website?
					</h2>
						<p>
							Each website is created differently. But most Online website editors (such as Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace, etc.) make it easy to add HTML code. You will need to  nd the tool within your website editor that will allow you to add HTML code to your site. You can usually find an HTML editor or code block in your tools. This is usually amongst other options of items to add such as text, photographs, links, etc. Usually if you  find this symbol &lt; / &gt;, that is the tool you will need. You may click on the logo for your website builder below, that will take you to their help section.

					<h2>
						I prefer to have Buildertrend add the integration to my website.
					</h2>
						<p>
							If you decide that you would like Buildertrend to add the login box to your website for you will need to respond to your email with the username and password to your website editor. This is a free service.
						</p>
						<hr>
					<h2>
						What does the integration look like?
					</h2>
						<p>
							Your login box is designed to match your branding or the current style of your website (below is just an example for reference, this is NOT your login box). <br />
							<img src="assets/loginbox-example-1.png" class="screenshot">
						</p>
						<hr>
					<h2>
						What is the next step?
					</h2>
						<p>
							Once you have added the code to your website and check that it looks correct, you are done! Now your clients/subs will be able to login to Buildertrend directly from your website.
						</p>
						<hr>	
					<h2>
						Can the integration be added to my Facebook page or Houzz account?
					</h2>
						<p>
							Unforunately no, these platforms do not allow for HTML to be added directly to these sites.
